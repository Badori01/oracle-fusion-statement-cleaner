# Oracle Fusion Statement Cleaner - Excel VBA Macro

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

This Excel VBA macro automates the cleanup and validation of raw financial statement data exported from **Oracle Fusion (Feogen)**. The tool solved a critical operational bottleneck for our team, reducing hours of manual work each month.

### âœ… Key Achievements
- Cut down statement processing time from hours to **seconds**
- Improved **data accuracy** and reduced risk of manual errors
- Helped standardize input formats across **finance operations**
- Enhanced team visibility into **duplicate or suspicious entries**

## ðŸ§  Problem It Solved

Our monthly statements from Oracle Fusion came in a raw, inconsistent format:
- PO and Invoice numbers were merged and unstructured (e.g. `912345/INV`)
- Some values were numeric, others alphanumeric or incomplete
- Many rows required validation and cleanup before use
- Rows with zero values or quantity needed to be cleaned out
- Invoice validation (e.g., offsetting positives/negatives) was manual
- Formatting inconsistencies made review slow and error-prone

## ðŸš€ The VBA Macro Solution

The macro, named `Split_PO_INV_WithSlash`, performs the following:

ðŸ”¹ **Splits** PO and Invoice numbers into structured columns  
ðŸ”¹ **Identifies and flags** inconsistent or suspicious entries  
ðŸ”¹ **Highlights duplicates** using conditional formatting  
ðŸ”¹ **Validates reversals** with logic based on value signs  
ðŸ”¹ **Removes noise**: rows with zero quantity and amount  
ðŸ”¹ **Auto-formats and filters** the result for quick review

This logic was fully customized to our business rules and statement structure.

## ðŸ”’ Note on Confidentiality

Due to the sensitivity of financial data and internal formatting rules:
- The actual VBA code is **not shared publicly**
- No sample Excel files or outputs are included

This repository serves as a **portfolio case study** to demonstrate the business value and technical thinking behind the solution.
